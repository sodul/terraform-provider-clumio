# clumio_policy (Resource)

Clumio Policy Resource used to schedule backups on Clumio supported data sources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "clumio_policy" "example" {
  name                   = "example-policy"
  organizational_unit_id = "organizational_unit_id"
  activation_status      = "activated"
  operations {
    action_setting = "window"
    type           = "aws_ebs_volume_backup"
    backup_window {
      start_time = "08:00"
      end_time   = "20:00"
    }
    slas {
      retention_duration {
        unit  = "days"
        value = 1
      }
      rpo_frequency {
        unit  = "days"
        value = 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) The unique name of the policy.
- **operations** (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations))

### Optional

- **activation_status** (String) The status of the policy. Valid values are:activated: Backups will take place regularly according to the policy SLA.deactivated: Backups will not begin until the policy is reactivated. The assets associated with the policy will have their compliance status set to deactivated.
- **organizational_unit_id** (String) The Clumio-assigned ID of the organizational unit associated with the policy.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) Policy Id.
- **lock_status** (String) Policy Lock Status.

<a id="nestedblock--operations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `operations`

Required:

- **action_setting** (String) Determines whether the policy should take action now or during the specified backup window. Valid values:immediate: to start backup process immediatelywindow: to start backup in the specified window
- **slas** (Block Set, Min: 1) The service level agreement (SLA) for the policy. A policy can include one or more SLAs. For example, a policy can retain daily backups for a month each, and monthly backups for a year each. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--slas))
- **type** (String) The operation to be performed for this SLA set.Each SLA set corresponds to one and only one operation.

Optional:

- **backup_window** (Block Set, Max: 1) The start and end times for the customized backup window. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--backup_window))

<a id="nestedblock--operations--slas"></a>
### Nested Schema for `operations.slas`

Required:

- **retention_duration** (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 1) The retention time for this SLA. For example, to retain the backup for 1 month, set unit=months and value=1. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--slas--retention_duration))
- **rpo_frequency** (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 1) The minimum frequency between backups for this SLA. Also known as the recovery point objective (RPO) interval. For example, to configure the minimum frequency between backups to be every 2 days, set unit=days and value=2. To configure the SLA for on-demand backups, set unit=on_demand and leave the value field empty. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--operations--slas--rpo_frequency))

<a id="nestedblock--operations--slas--retention_duration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `operations.slas.retention_duration`

Required:

- **unit** (String) The measurement unit of the SLA parameter. Values include hours, days, months, and years.
- **value** (Number) The measurement value of the SLA parameter.


<a id="nestedblock--operations--slas--rpo_frequency"></a>
### Nested Schema for `operations.slas.rpo_frequency`

Required:

- **unit** (String) The measurement unit of the SLA parameter. Values include hours, days, months, and years.
- **value** (Number) The measurement value of the SLA parameter.



<a id="nestedblock--operations--backup_window"></a>
### Nested Schema for `operations.backup_window`

Required:

- **end_time** (String) The time when the backup window closes. Specify the end time in the format hh:mm, where hh represents the hour of the day and mm represents the minute of the day based on the 24 hour clock.
- **start_time** (String) The time when the backup window opens. Specify the start time in the format hh:mm, where hh represents the hour of the day and mm represents the minute of the day based on the 24 hour clock.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Replace POLICY_ID with the correct Clumio Policy ID.
terraform import clumio_policy.example POLICY_ID
```
