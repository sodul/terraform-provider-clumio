# clumio_policy_rule (Resource)

Clumio Policy Rule Resource used to determine how a policy should be assigned to assets.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "clumio_policy_rule" "example_1" {
  name           = "example-policy-rule-1"
  policy_id      = "policy_id"
  before_rule_id = clumio_policy_rule.example_2.id
  condition      = "{\"entity_type\":{\"$eq\":\"aws_ebs_volume\"}, \"aws_account_native_id\":{\"$in\":[\"aws_account_id_1\", \"aws_account_id_2\"]}, \"aws_tag\":{\"$eq\":{\"key\":\"aws_tag_key\", \"value\":\"aws_tag_value\"}}}"
}

resource "clumio_policy_rule" "example_2" {
  name           = "example-policy-rule-2"
  policy_id      = "policy_id"
  before_rule_id = ""
  condition      = "{\"entity_type\":{\"$eq\":\"aws_ec2_instance\"}, \"aws_account_native_id\":{\"$eq\":\"aws_account_id_1\"}, \"aws_region\":{\"$eq\":\"us-west-2\"}, \"aws_tag\":{\"$contains\":{\"key\":\"aws_tag_key_substr\", \"value\":\"aws_tag_value_substr\"}}}"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `before_rule_id` (String) The policy rule ID before which this policy rule should be inserted. An empty value will set the rule to have lowest priority. NOTE: If in the Global Organizational Unit, rules can also be prioritized against two virtual rules maintained by the system: `asset-level-rule` and `child-ou-rule`. `asset-level-rule` corresponds to the priority of Direct Assignments (when a policy is applied directly to an asset) whereas `child-ou-rule` corresponds to the priority of rules created by child organizational units.
- `condition` (String) The condition of the policy rule. Possible conditions include: 1) `entity_type` is required and supports `$eq` and `$in` filters. 2) `aws_account_native_id` and `aws_region` are optional and both support `$eq` and `$in` filters. 3) `aws_tag` is optional and supports `$eq`, `$in`, `$all`, and `$contains` filters.
- `name` (String) The name of the policy rule.
- `policy_id` (String) The policy ID of the policy to be applied to the assets.

### Optional

- `organizational_unit_id` (String) The Clumio-assigned ID of the organizational unit to be associated with the policy rule.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Policy Rule Id.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Replace POLICY_RULE_ID with the correct Clumio Policy Rule ID.
terraform import clumio_policy_rule.example POLICY_RULE_ID
```
